## What is this?

These guidelines help contributors to our projects understand our workflow and
how to contribute to our projects. Following these guidelines helps communicate
that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open
source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing
your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Contribute what?

There are different ways to contribute to a project. Some ways to contribute
are...

* Writing code
* Submitting bug reports / feature requests
* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials / blog posts


## Getting started

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Create changes in your fork.
    * Run unit tests once you're done!
3. Send a pull request to our repo.

## Report a bug

When filing an issue, answer these five questions:

1. What version of NodeJS / npm / python / Go are you using?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Request a feature

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

- Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the project.


## Ground rules

These ground rules are the basic responsibilities for contributing to the
project.

* **DO's**
    * DO run unit tests before submitting a pull request
    * DO create issues first for major changes / enhancements you want to make
        * Discuss things transparently first and get community feedback
    * DO keep each pull request to _one_ feature / bug fix
        * If you want to submit multiple things, submit multiple pull requests
    * DO write unit tests for new features
    * DO write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* **DON'Ts**
    * DON'T commit changes to files irrelevant to your pull request (e.g.
	  `gitignore`)

## Code review process

The core team at the VinBigdata - Medical Imaging department reviews pull requests on a
weekly basis. The core team may vary â€“ see an updated list in the [project index](https://github.com/vinbigdata-medical/vinlab-sites/blob/master/PROJECT-INDEX.md).
